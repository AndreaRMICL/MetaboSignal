Description: MetaboSignal is an R package that allows merging,
        analyzing and customizing metabolic and signaling KEGG
        pathways. It is a network-based approach designed to explore
        the topological relationship between genes (signaling- or
        enzymatic-genes) and metabolites, representing a powerful tool
        to investigate the genetic landscape and regulatory networks of
        metabolic phenotypes.

Description: MetaboSignal is an R package that allows merging, analyzing and customizing metabolic and signaling KEGG pathways. It is a network-based approach designed to explore the topological relationship between genes (signaling- or enzymatic-genes) and metabolites, representing a powerful tool to investigate the genetic landscape and regulatory networks of metabolic phenotypes.

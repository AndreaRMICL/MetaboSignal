The shortest\npath length between two nodes is defined as the minimum number of edges between\nthese two nodes.\n}\n\\usage{\nMetaboSignal_distances(network_table, organism_code, organism_name, mode = \"SP\",\n                       source_genes = \"all\", target_metabolites = \"all\", names = FALSE)\n}\n\\arguments{\n  \\item{network_table}{two-column matrix where each row represents an edge\n  between two nodes. See function \"MetaboSignal_matrix ( )\".\n  }\n  \\item{organism_code}{character vector containing the KEGG code for the organism\n  of interest. For example the KEGG code for the rat is \"rno\". See the function\n  \"MS_FindKEGG( )\".\n  }\n  \\item{organism_name}{character vector containing the common name of the organism of\n  interest (e.g. \"rat\", \"mouse\", \"human\", \"zebrafish\") or taxonomy id. For more\n  details, check: http://docs.mygene.info/en/latest/doc/data.html#species. This\n  argument is only required when source_genes are gene symbols.\n  }\n  \\item{mode}{character constant indicating whether a directed or an undirected\n  network will be considered. \"all\" indicates that all the edges of the network\n  will be considered as undirected. \"out\" indicates that all the edges of the\n  network will be considered as directed. \"SP\" indicates that all network will\n  be considered as directed except the edges linked to target metabolite, which\n  will be considered as undirected. The difference between the \"out\" and the \"SP\"\n  options, is that the latter aids reaching target metabolites that are substrates\n  of irreversible reactions. By default, mode = \"SP\".\n  }\n  \\item{source_genes}{character vector containing the genes from which the\n  shortest paths will be calculated. All input genes need to have the same ID\n  format. Possible ID formats are: entrez IDs, official gene symbols, or gene\n  nodes of the network (i.e. KEGG orthology IDs or KEGG gene IDs). The latter\n  option allows reducing the time required to compute this function. Entrez IDs\n  or gene symbols can be transformed into KEGG IDs using the function\n  \"MS_GetKEGG_GeneID( )\". By default, genes = \"all\" indicating that all genes or\n  reactions of the network will be used.\n  }\n  \\item{target_metabolites}{character vector containing the KEGG IDs of the\n  metabolites to which the shortest paths will be calculated. Compound KEGG IDs\n  can be obtained using the function \"MS_FindKEGG( )\". By default,\n  metabolites = \"all\", indicating that all metabolites of the network will be\n  used.\n  }\n  \\item{names}{logical scalar indicating whether the metabolite IDs or gene KEGG\n  IDs will be transformed into common metabolite names or gene symbols. Reaction\n  IDs remain unchanged. By default, names = FALSE.\n  }\n }\n\\value{\nA matrix containing the shortest path length from the genes or reactions (in the\nrows) to the metabolites (in the columns).
